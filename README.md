# Brain-Computer Interface Movement Decoding
This repository has the source code for an ML project that uses electroencephalogram (EEG) signals to determine whether a user wants to choose the left or right choice. The accompanying PDF file, Brain-Computer-Interface-Movement-Decoding.pdf, has extensive information on the modeling technique, outcomes, etc.

## Modeling Approach
From the subject's EEG data, we trained a support vector machine to distinguish between left and right planned movements. To deal with the dataset's high dimensionality, an SVM was used. The accompanying PDF details the several enhancements made to a simple SVM.
